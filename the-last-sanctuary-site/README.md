> **Built by gods who grew tired of eternity — kept alive by those who still feel.**

**The Last Sanctuary** is a meditative narrative experience about tending a flock at the end of time.  
Created in Unreal Engine 5.6, it blends cosmic-scale lore with quiet pastoral gameplay — a place where the player becomes the shepherd of the final meadow.

## 🎮 Game Concept
When the gods grew weary of infinity, they built one last, stubbornly real world —  
a meadow filled with sheep that dream of the stars.  
You arrive as the Shepherd: the last to feel, the first to remember.
